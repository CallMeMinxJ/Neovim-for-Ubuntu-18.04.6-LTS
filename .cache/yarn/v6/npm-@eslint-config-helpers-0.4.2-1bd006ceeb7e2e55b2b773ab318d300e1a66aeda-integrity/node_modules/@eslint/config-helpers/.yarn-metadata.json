    "readme": "# @eslint/config-helpers\n\n## Description\n\nHelper utilities for creating ESLint configuration.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor Node.js and compatible runtimes:\n\n```shell\nnpm install @eslint/config-helpers\n# or\nyarn add @eslint/config-helpers\n# or\npnpm install @eslint/config-helpers\n# or\nbun add @eslint/config-helpers\n```\n\nFor Deno:\n\n```shell\ndeno add @eslint/config-helpers\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### `defineConfig()`\n\nThe `defineConfig()` function allows you to specify an ESLint configuration with full type checking and additional capabilities, such as `extends`. Here's an example:\n\n```js\n// eslint.config.js\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@eslint/config-helpers\";\nimport js from \"@eslint/js\";\n\nexport default defineConfig([\n\t{\n\t\tfiles: [\"src/**/*.js\"],\n\t\tplugins: { js },\n\t\textends: [\"js/recommended\"],\n\t\trules: {\n\t\t\tsemi: \"error\",\n\t\t\t\"prefer-const\": \"error\",\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tfiles: [\"test/**/*.js\"],\n\t\trules: {\n\t\t\t\"no-console\": \"off\",\n\t\t},\n\t},\n]);\n```\n\n### `globalIgnores()`\n\nThe `globalIgnores()` function allows you to specify patterns for files and directories that should be globally ignored by ESLint. This is useful for excluding files that you don't want to lint, such as build directories or third-party libraries. Here's an example:\n\n```js\n// eslint.config.js\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from \"@eslint/config-helpers\";\n\nexport default defineConfig([\n\t{\n\t\tfiles: [\"src/**/*.js\"],\n\t\trules: {\n\t\t\tsemi: \"error\",\n\t\t\t\"prefer-const\": \"error\",\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\tglobalIgnores([\"node_modules/\", \"dist/\", \"coverage/\"]),\n]);\n```\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n\n<!-- NOTE: This section is autogenerated.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
