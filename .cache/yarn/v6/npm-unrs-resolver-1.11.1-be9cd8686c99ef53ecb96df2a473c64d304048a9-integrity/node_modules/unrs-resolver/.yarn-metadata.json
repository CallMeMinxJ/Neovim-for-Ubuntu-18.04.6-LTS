takes `paths` and `references` into account [at the same time](https://github.com/unrs/unrs-resolver/pull/12)\n> - `references` should [take higher priority](https://github.com/unrs/unrs-resolver/pull/13)\n> - support `pnpapi` core module and [package deep link](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/issues/253)\n> - enable [more targets](https://github.com/unrs/unrs-resolver/pull/29) support\n> - absolute path aliasing [should not be skipped](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-import-resolver-typescript/issues/401)\n> - use [napi-postinstall] for [legacy npm versions](https://github.com/unrs/unrs-resolver/issues/56)\n> -

support extending tsconfig defined in `tsconfig.extends`\n  - support paths alias defined in `tsconfig.compilerOptions.paths`\n  - support project references defined `tsconfig.references`\n  - support [template variable ${configDir} for substitution of config files directory path](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58042)\n- Supports in-memory file system via the `FileSystem` trait.\n- Contains `tracing` instrumentation.\n\n## Usage\n\n### npm package\n\nSee `index.d.ts` for `resolveSync` and `ResolverFactory` API.\n\nQuick example:\n\n```javascript\nimport assert from 'node:assert';\nimport path from 'node:path';\n\nimport resolve, { ResolverFactory } from 'unrs-resolver';\n\n// `resolve`\nassert(resolve.sync(process.cwd(), './index.js').path, path.resolve('index.js'));\n\n// `ResolverFactory`\nconst resolver = new ResolverFactory();\nassert(resolver.sync(process.cwd(), './index.js').path, path.resolve('index.js'));\n```\n\n### Supports WASM\n\nSee https://stackblitz.com/edit/unrs-resolver for usage example.\n\n### Rust\n\nSee [docs.rs/unrs_resolver](https://docs.rs/unrs_resolver/latest/unrs_resolver/).\n\n### [Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp)\n\n- For node.js, yarn pnp should work without any configuration, given the following conditions:\n  - the program is called with the `yarn` command, where the value [`process.versions.pnp`](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnpapi#processversionspnp) is set.\n  - `.pnp.cjs` manifest file exists in the closest directory, searched from the current working directory,\n  - no multi-project setup, per second bullet point in [FIND_PNP_MANIFEST](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec#find_pnp_manifest)\n\n## Terminology\n\n### `directory`\n\nAn **absolute** path to a directory where the specifier is resolved against.\n\nFor CommonJS modules, it is the `__dirname` variable that contains the absolute path to the folder containing current module.\n\nFor ECMAScript modules, it is the value of `import.meta.dirname`.\n\nBehavior is undefined when given a path to a file.\n\n### `specifier`\n\nThe string passed to `require` or `import`, i.e. `require(\"specifier\")` or `import \"specifier\"`\n\n## Errors and Trouble Shooting\n\n- `Error: Package subpath '.' is not defined by \"exports\" in` - occurs when resolving without `conditionNames`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe following usages apply to both Rust and Node.js; the code snippets are written in JavaScript.\n\nTo handle the `exports` field in `package.json`, ESM and CJS need to be differentiated.\n\n### ESM\n\nPer [ESM Resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm)\n\n> defaultConditions is the conditional environment name array, [\"node\", \"import\"].\n\nThis means when the caller is an ESM import (`import \"module\"`), resolve options should be\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"conditionNames\": [\"node\", \"import\"]\n}\n```\n\n### CJS\n\nPer [CJS Resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together)\n\n> LOAD_PACKAGE_EXPORTS(X, DIR)\n>\n> 5. let MATCH = PACKAGE_EXPORTS_RESOLVE(pathToFileURL(DIR/NAME), \".\" + SUBPATH,\n>    `package.json` \"exports\", [\"node\", \"require\"]) defined in the ESM resolver.\n\nThis means when the caller is a CJS require (`require(\"module\")`), resolve options should be\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"conditionNames\": [\"node\", \"require\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Cache\n\nTo support both CJS and ESM with the same cache:\n\n```javascript\nconst esmResolver = new ResolverFactory({\n  conditionNames: ['node', 'import'],\n});\n\nconst cjsResolver = esmResolver.cloneWithOptions({\n  conditionNames: ['node', 'require'],\n});\n```\n\n### Browser Field\n\nFrom this [non-standard spec](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec):\n\n> The `browser` field is provided to JavaScript bundlers or component tools when packaging modules for client side use.\n\nThe option is\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"aliasFields\": [\"browser\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Main Field\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mainFields\": [\"module\", \"main\"]\n}\n```\n\nQuoting esbuild's documentation:\n\n- `main` - This is [the standard field](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#main) for all packages that are meant to be used with node. The name main is hard-coded in to node's module resolution logic itself. Because it's intended for use with node, it's reasonable to expect that the file path in this field is a CommonJS-style module.\n- `module` - This field came from a [proposal](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/f31319be735b21739756b87d551f6711bd7aa283/proposal.md) for how to integrate ECMAScript modules into node. Because of this, it's reasonable to expect that the file path in this field is an ECMAScript-style module. This proposal wasn't adopted by node (node uses \"type\": \"module\" instead) but it was adopted by major bundlers because ECMAScript-style modules lead to better tree shaking, or dead code removal.\n- `browser` - This field came from a [proposal](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901/49493836fb873ddaa4b8a7aa0ef2352119f69211) that allows bundlers to replace node-specific files or modules with their browser-friendly versions. It lets you specify an alternate browser-specific entry point. Note that it is possible for a package to use both the browser and module field together (see the note below).\n\n## Options\n\nThe following options are aligned with [enhanced-resolve], and is implemented for Rust crate usage.\n\nSee [index.d.ts](https://github.com/unrs/unrs-resolver/blob/main/napi/index.d.ts) for Node.js usage.\n\n| Field                                 | Default
