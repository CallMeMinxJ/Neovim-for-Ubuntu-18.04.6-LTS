Returns the docblock contained in `contents`. If `contents` did not contain a docblock, it will return the empty string (`\"\"`).\n\n### `strip(contents: string): string`\n\nStrips the top docblock from a file and return the result. If a file does not have a docblock at the top, then return the file unchanged.\n\n### `parse(docblock: string): {[key: string]: string | string[] }`\n\nParses the pragmas in a docblock string into an object whose keys are the pragma tags and whose values are the arguments to those pragmas.\n\n### `parseWithComments(docblock: string): { comments: string, pragmas: {[key: string]: string | string[]} }`\n\nSimilar to `parse` except this method also returns the comments from the docblock. Useful when used with `print()`.\n\n### `print({ comments?: string, pragmas?: {[key: string]: string | string[]} }): string`\n\nPrints an object of key-value pairs back into a docblock. If `comments` are provided, they will be positioned on the top of the docblock.\n",
